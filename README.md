# GerstnerWaves

GOAL
Recreate sea waves using a mesh array of points and custom math (Vector, Capsule, Sphere, Transform...) 
How I resolved it: 
I applied the Gerstner waves formula to simulate realistic wave motion. Additionally, I implemented buoyancy logic to simulate how a buoy moves naturally on the sea surface. 
What I learned: 
I learned how to work within constraints by adapting my code to an existing fixed script without modifying it, which helped me improve my problem-solving and integration skills.
